### Hi there, I'm [Arturo](https://arturojc.com/) ðŸ‘‹

I am a philosopher and self-taught developer based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and I am currently seeking an internship or entry-level position.

I write about my journey into software development [over at my blog](https://arturojc355400397.wordpress.com/)
